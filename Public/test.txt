Baby - Justin Bieber,Ludacris
 Oh whoa
 Oh whoa
 Oh whoa
 You know you love me, I know you care
 Just shout whenever, and I&#39;ll be there
 You are my love, you are my heart
 And we would never ever ever be apart
 Are we an item?
 Girl, quit playing
 Were just friends, what are you saying
 Said there&#39;s another and looked right in my eyes
 My first love broke my heart for the first time
 And I was like
 Baby, baby, baby oooh
 Like baby, baby, baby nooo
 Like baby, baby, baby oooh
 I thought you&#39;d always be mine mine
 Baby, baby, baby oooh
 Like baby, baby, baby nooo
 Like baby, baby, baby oooh
 I thought you&#39;d always be mine mine
 Oh, for you I would have done whatever
 And I just can&#39;t believe we aren&#39;t together
 And I wanna play it cool, but I&#39;m losin&#39; you
 I&#39;ll buy you anything, I&#39;ll buy you diamond ring
 And I&#39;m in pieces, baby fix me
 And just shake me &#39;til you wake me from this bad dream
 I&#39;m going down, down, down, down
 And I just can&#39;t believe my first love won&#39;t be around
 And I&#39;m like
 Baby, baby, baby oooh
 Like baby, baby, baby nooo
 Like baby, baby, baby oooh
 I thought you&#39;d always be mine mine
 Baby, baby, baby oooh
 Like baby, baby, baby nooo
 Like baby, baby, baby oooh
 I thought you&#39;d always be mine mine

 When I was 13, I had my first love
 There was nobody that compared to my baby
 And nobody came between us who could ever come above
 She had me going crazy, oh, I was star-struck
 She woke me up daily, don&#39;t need no Starbucks
 She made my heart pound
 It skipped a beat when I see her in the street and
 At school on the playground
 But I really wanna see her on the weekend
 She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing
 And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying
 Baby, baby, baby oooh
 Like baby, baby, baby nooo
 Like baby, baby, baby oooh
 I thought you&#39;d always be mine mine
 Baby, baby, baby oooh
 Like baby, baby, baby nooo
 Like baby, baby, baby oooh
 I thought you&#39;d always be mine mine
 I&#39;m gone
 Yeah yeah yeah, yeah
 Now I&#39;m all gone
 Yeah yeah yeah, yeah
 Now I&#39;m all gone
 Yeah yeah yeah, yeah
 Now I&#39;m all gone gone, gone
 I&#39;m gone
